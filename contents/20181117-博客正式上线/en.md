After all these developing, testing and data migrating these months, I am excited to announce that the new VicBlog is now ONLINE!!

The new blog features:

- Static blog based on Gatsby v2
- Support PWA (how about try this website on your phone?)
- Supports comment via [gitalk](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk)
- Travis-CI for automatic CI and CD
- Full TypeScript

This blog is near perfection by my current standards.

> There is nothing new to implement in my blog now. All that remains are little tweaks.

Thank you for all your kind supports! Please [feedback](/en/feedback) and comments more!
