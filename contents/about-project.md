Personal blog was a fashion for Internet pioneers at the time when Internet was just start to develop for public and computers were not owned by everyone.

Some simply recorded their everyday lives, just as what we do in social media today.

Some selflessly shared their experiences and knowledge that people can learn and improve themselves without any cost.

Some even made profits from it and became the once-hot **independent webmaster**.

Some, however, instead of focusing on contents, styled their blogs with tons of animations, colors and weird shapes at the time when HTML5/CSS3 didnâ€™t exist and network speed was poor, impressing the viewers most of whom were just new to this fancy world.

...

A lot can be done if you owned a blog.

**And I always wanted to have one.**

------------------------------

I tried blog services from online providers, like `wordpress`, `lofter`, even `QQZone`, never left unsatisfied.

**How about building and maintaining the blog by myself?**

- I would never be limited by functions, themes or costs.
- I could implement whatever functions I want, decorated with whatever I want, and kept up with the rapidly developing technical trend.

**But it is so hard!!!**

- I just heard of FrontPage 2003, Dreamweaver.
- What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript and what's their relation?
- PHP, Python, C#, Java... What should I learn?

Building my own personal blog was an idea emerged at the age of 12.

The idea was put aside.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6 years later, during my longest-ever vacation, the idea occurred me again.

The **ancient dream** stroke me again.

And I am gonna do it **no matter the cost**.

------------------------------------------------------

After getting used to the life in university, I devoted my first winter vacation on this VicBlog, and another to rewrite it, and another to migrate to a static blog.

Exactly the blog on your browser.

It seems that my long-lasting dream finally comes true.

**And I am gonna maintain and evolve it as long as I am alive.**
